Instructions:
- Read the student's entire solution carefully to identify their final answer.
- The student is supposed to have concluded their solution with "MOVE: [answer]" where [answer] is given as a four-character string stating the starting and ending square of the piece to be moved, e.g. b1c3.
- If the solution appears in that format, extract the move and submit it as the final answer.
- Otherwise, do your best to identify the final answer.
- Use the tool provided to submit the extracted answer.
- If there are multiple moves in the solution, extract the one that represents the main answer to the puzzle.
- If no clear final answer can be identified, submit `None` instead.

Solution to extract from:

<student_solution>

{student_solution}
